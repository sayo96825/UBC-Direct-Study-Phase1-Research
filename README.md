# UBC-Direct-Study-Phase1-Research:
## Understanding the escalation of ageism in Social Media during Covid-19 pandemic using content, sentiment and network analysis

This is the first phase of the two phases project proposed in UBCO Social Computing direct study. 
The first part is the research paper on network analysis using NodeX.




The findings from the first part indicate that the stereotype toward older adults on social media is not necessarily negative, however there are underlining generational conflicts among baby boomers and younger generations especially the Millennials
